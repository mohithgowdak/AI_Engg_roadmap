Project idea: "Intelligent Research Assistant with Multi-Source RAG"
What it does
An AI research assistant that:
Accepts research questions
Searches multiple sources (web, PDFs, databases)
Synthesizes information from all sources
Generates a research report with citations
Maintains conversation context for follow-ups
Provides source verification and fact-checking
Why it's technically challenging
Multi-agent system: separate agents for web search, document analysis, and synthesis
Advanced RAG: combines multiple vector stores (web results, PDFs, custom docs)
Memory management: tracks research sessions and conversation history
Custom tools: web scraping, PDF parsing, citation formatting
Chain orchestration: coordinates multiple chains (retrieval → analysis → synthesis → formatting)
Streaming output: real-time report generation
Error handling: handles missing sources, API failures, and conflicting information
LangChain features it showcases
Agents with custom tools
Multiple vector stores (Chroma/FAISS)
Document loaders (PDF, web, text)
Memory (conversation and research context)
Custom chains (research pipeline)
Output parsers (structured reports)
Streaming (real-time updates)
Callbacks (progress tracking)
